There are two sides that are competing dominance over the land.
In order to win one side must eliminate all influence from the enemy.
To do this, both players will take turns attacking each other. 
Players can only attack up, down, right and left from their tile.
It is worth noting, that defenders will have an advantage,
You can transfer troops from one friendly tile to another.
As troops deplete, occasional reinforcements will come,
Tiles with the lowest amount of soldiers will gain more,
While the highest ones will gain less per reinforcement.
You cannot cross water.
